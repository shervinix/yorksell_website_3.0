      acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "We strongly recommend it. A pre-approval sets your real budget, makes your offers more competitive, and avoids the disappointment of falling in love with a property you can't finance. We can connect you with trusted mortgage brokers if you need one." },

      name: "How long does a typical search take?",

      "@type": "Question",
      name: "What is a deposit and how much do I need?",
      acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "A deposit is submitted with your offer and held in trust until closing. In Toronto, deposits typically range from $25,000 to 5% of the purchase price depending on the property type and market conditions. It forms part of your down payment." },
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      name: "What happens if my offer isn't accepted?",
      acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "We debrief on what happened: price, conditions, competing bids. We adjust strategy if needed and keep searching. Multiple offer rounds are common in Toronto. Each one builds a clearer picture of the market and what it takes to win." },
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      name: "Can you help me buy a pre-construction property?",
      acceptedAnswer: { "@type": "Answer", text: "Yes. Pre-construction involves different timelines, deposit structures, and risks than resale. We walk you through the assignment clauses, developer reputation, and long-term value considerations before you commit." },

                  We spend extra time with first-time buyers to make sure every step is explained clearly before it happens. You won&apos;t feel rushed, pressured, or lost in the paperwork. We have done this enough times to know where first-timers get tripped up, and we make sure you don&apos;t.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-[var(--muted)]">
                  We will also make sure you are claiming every rebate and incentive you are entitled to. Most first-time buyers leave money on the table simply because nobody told them it existed.
